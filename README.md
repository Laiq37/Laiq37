- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Syed Laiq Afzal
- ðŸ‘€ I am a software engineer specializing in mobile app development, currently employed as a Mobile App Developer at Genetech Solutions. My expertise lies in Flutter, API         integration (including Firebase and Google SDK), and push notifications. I also possess knowledge of Node.js and Express.js. I am currently expanding my skill set by           delving into the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and have a strong interest in this area.

    I am always eager to learn new technologies and tackle fresh challenges, particularly those related to Flutter backend development and AI. I am highly motivated and            continuously strive to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. Seeking opportunities to further explore and contribute to cutting-edge advancements is my primary      goal.
